# Speech to Text Converter

A simple web application that uses the Web Speech API to convert spoken words into text.

## Description

## Features
- **Selectable Languages:** English (India), Hindi, Japanese, and German.
- **Continuous Speech Recognition:** Recognizes speech continuously without the need to stop and start the recognition process.
- **Interim Results:** Displays interim results (words that the speech recognition engine thinks the user is saying but has not yet confirmed).
- **Final Results:** Displays final confirmed words that the user has spoken.
